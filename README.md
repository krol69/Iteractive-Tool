# slido-local (localhost Slido-style tool)

## Quick Start (localhost only)
```bash
pnpm install
# Initialize DB
pnpm --filter @slido-local/server db:push
pnpm --filter @slido-local/server db:seed

# Dev (web:3000, api:4000) â€” both bound to 127.0.0.1 by default
pnpm dev

# Build & run (localhost)
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 then navigate to `/e/demo-event` to try the seeded event.

> To allow LAN later, set `ALLOW_LAN=true` and `HOST=0.0.0.0` (server). Keep defaults for strict localhost.
